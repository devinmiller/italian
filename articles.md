# Articles

_Articles_ are words used to signal nouns and to specify their application.  

The article that allows you to signal persons, objects, etc. in a specific way is called _definite_; the article that allows you to designate nonspecific persons, objects, etc. is called _indefinite_.  

Definite and indefinite articles vary according to the noun's gender, number, and initial sound.
