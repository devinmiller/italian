# Reflexive Verbs

A verb is _reflexive_ when it has an identical subject and direct object, as in _she washes herself_.  Reflexive verbs are conjugated in exactly the same manner as non-reflexive verbs, but with reflexive pronouns.

| Person | Singular | Plural |
| 1st | **mi** / _myself_ | **ci** / _ourselves |
| 2nd | **ti** / _yourself_ (fam.) | **vi** / _yourselves_  (fam.) |
| 3rd | **si** / _himself, herself, yourself_ (pol.) | **si** / _themselves, yourselves_ (pol.) |

A reflexive verb is identifiable by the ending **-si** / _oneself_.
