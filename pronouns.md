# Pronomi

Pronouns are useful when we want to indicate or replace a person or an object that are doing an action, or receiving an action, without repeating or specifying their name again in a sentence.

## Pronomi Personali

Just like in English, personal pronouns in Italian can be **emphatic** (tonici – with tonic accent) or **non-emphatic** (atoni – without tonic accent).

- Ho dato la matita **a lui** – (I gave the pencil to him) | **emphatic**
- **Gli** ho dato la matita – (I gave him the pencil) | **non-emphatic**

These type of pronouns can be further divided into Subject, Direct Object or Indirect Object pronouns.

### Pronomi Soggetto

As the name says, these **pronouns** are used to specify the **subject** (who?) of a sentence. These pronouns can only be **emphatic**, therefore there is no non-emphatic version.

| Persona | Singolare | Singular | Plurale | Plural |
| ------- | --------- | -------- | ------- | ------ |
| 1st     | io        | _I_      | noi     | _we_   |
| 2nd     | tu        | _you_    | voi     | _you_  |
| 3rd     | lui/lei   | _he/she_ | loro    | _they_ |

### Pronomi Complemento Oggetto Diretti

The direct object pronouns can be both **emphatic** (_tonici_ – with tonic accent) or **non-emphatic** (_atoni_ – without tonic accent) and they answer the question "**chi?**” or “**che cosa?**” (_who?_ or _what?_). They are mostly used in the non-emphatic version, unless there is a need to emphasize the person concerned.

#### Pronomi Diretti Tonici

As the name suggests, they are mainly used to emphasizes the person concerned and they generally come after the verb. They are called _tonici_ in Italian because they possess a tonic accent.

| Persona | Singolare | Singular  | Plurale | Plural |
| ------- | --------- | --------- | ------- | ------ |
| 1st     | me        | _me_      | noi     | _us_   |
| 2nd     | te        | _you_     | voi     | _you_  |
| 3rd     | lui/lei   | _him/her_ | loro    | _them_ |

#### Pronomi Diretti Atoni 

Most direct object pronouns are used in the non-emphatic form (_atoni_). They are normally placed before the verb.

| Persona | Singolare | Singular | Plurale | Plural      |
| ------- | --------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| 1st     | mi        | _me_     | ci      | _us_        |
| 2nd     | ti        | _you_    | vi      | _you_       |
| 3rd     | lo        | _him_    | li      | _them (m.)_ |
|         | la        | _her_    | le      | _them (f.)_ |

### Pronomi Complemento Oggetto Indiretti

The indirect object pronouns can also be both **emphatic** (_tonici_ – with tonic accent) or **non-emphatic** (_atoni_ – without tonic accent) and they answer the question “**a chi?**” or “**a che cosa?**” (_to whom?_ or _to what?_). Just like the direct object pronouns, they are mostly used in the non-emphatic version, unless there is a need to emphasize the person concerned.

#### Pronomi Indiretti Tonici 

They are very similar to the direct object pronouns. The only difference is that they are preceded by the “_a_” particle. They are called _tonici_ in Italian because they possess a tonic accent.

| Persona | Singolare   | Singular        | Plurale | Plural    |
| ------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------- | --------- |
| 1st     | a me        | _to me_         | a noi   | _to us_   |
| 2nd     | a te        | _to you_        | a voi   | _to you_  |
| 3rd     | a lui/a lei | _to him/to her_ | a loro  | _to them_ |

#### Pronomi Indiretti Atoni

Most direct object pronouns are used in the non-emphatic form (_atoni_). They are normally placed before the verb.

| Persona | Singolare | Singular | Plurale  | Plural      |
| ------- | --------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1st     | mi        | _me_     | ci       | _us_        |
| 2nd     | ti        | _you_    | vi       | _you_       |
| 3rd     | gli       | _him_    | loro/gli | _them (m.)_ |
|         | le        | _her_    | loro/gli | _them (f.)_ |

### Pronomi Combinati

Direct and Indirect object pronouns in the non-emphatic form can be combined to create the **double object pronouns**.

|         | lo     | la     | li     | le     | ne     |
| :-------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
| **mi**  | me lo  | me la  | me li  | me le  | me ne  |
| **ti**  | te lo  | te la  | te li  | te le  | te ne  |
| **gli** | glielo | gliela | glieli | gliele | gliene |
| **ci** |
