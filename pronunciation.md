# Pronunciation

How to pronounce the letters of the alphabet in Italian.

## Vowels

The letters that represent vowels are the same in Italian as in English, though the sounds represented can differ.

### A

**A** is pronounced like the English _a_ in _father_, or as in the exclamation _ah!_: **Anna** (Ahn-nah) _Anne_ and _Anna_. 

### E

**E** is pronounced like the _e_ in _bet_, or as in the exclamation _eh!_: **Emma** (Ehm-mah) _Emma_.

### I

**I** is pronounced like the _i_ sound in _machine_, or as in the exclamation _eeh!_: **Ida** (EEh-dah) _Ida_.

### O

**O** is pronounced like the _o_ sound in _sorry_, or as in the exclamation _oh!_: **Otto** (Oht-toh) _Otto_.

### U

**U** is pronounced like the _oo_ sound in _boot_, or as in the exclamation _ooh!_: **Ugo** (OOh-goh) _Hugh_ and _Hugo_.

## Dipthongs

The Italian letter **i** sounds similar to the English _y_ in _yes_ before a stressed vowel.

The Italian letter **u** sounds similar to the English _w_ in _way_ before a stressed vowel.

In some words **i** and **u** are pronounced as belonging to seperate syllables.  There is no accent in Italian to indicate this behavior.

In most words, the stress falls on the next-to-last syllable.

However, that is not always the case.

Words with an accent mark on the final vowel means that vowel must be stressed.

## Consonants

Most Italian consonants are pronounced in the same way they are pronounced in English.  TheItalian alphabet contains many of the same characters, except for the letters **j, k, w, x,** and **y**.

The letter **h** exists in Italian, but it is not pronounced.

### P

The Italian letter **p** is not accompanied by a puff of air as at the beginning of some English words.

### T / D

The sound of Italian letters **t** and **d** do not correspond directly to the sounds of the English letters.  The tounge is placed on the upper teeth, not just above them.  Like the letter **p** they should produce less air.

### L

The sound of Italian _l_ is the same as the English _l_ in _love_, but never like _l_ and the end of a syllable or word like _bill_ or _filler_.

### GLI

The sound represented by **gli** is similar to the English _lli_ in _million_, but much more forceful.

### GN

The sound represented by **gn** is similar to the English _ny_ in _canyon_, but much more forceful.

### S

The Italian **s** can be both the English _s_ sound in the word _sip_, or the _z_ sound in _zip_.

The Italian **z** sound is used before **b, d, g, l, m, n, r, v** and between vowels; otherwise the **s** sound is used.

### Z

The letter **z** stands for the _ts_ sound as in the English word _cats_ or the _ds_ sound as in _lads_.

### R

To pronounce the Italian letter **r**, roll your tounge a few times on the ridge above your top front teeth.

### K

The hard **k** sound is spelled as **c** before consonants and the vowels **a**, **o**, and **u**.  It is spelled **ch** before the vowels **e** and **i**.  

The sound sequence **kw** is spelled (usually) as **qu**.

### CH

The soft **ch** sound (as in _church_) is specced as **c** before the vowels **e** and **i**.  It is spelled as **ci** before the vowels **a**, **o**, and **u**.  

### G

The hard **g** sound is spelled as **g** before consonants and the vowels **a**, **o**, and **u**.  It is spelled **gh** before the vowels **e** and **i**. 

The sound sequence **gw** is spelled (usually) as **gu**.

### J

The soft **j** sound is spelled as **g** before the vowels **e** and **i**.  It is spelled as **gi** before the vowels **a**, **o**, and **u**

### SK

The sound **sk** is spelled as **sc** before consonants and the vowels **a**, **o**, and **u**. It is spelled **sch** before the vowels **e** and **i**.

The soft **sh** (as in _shoe_) is spelled as **sc** before the vowels **e** and **i**.
