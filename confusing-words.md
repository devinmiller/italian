## Long Version

In Italian, the words "solo," "appena," "appunto," and "proprio" can all translate to "just" in English, but they are used in different contexts and can convey slightly different meanings. Let's look at each one and see when to use them:

### 1. Solo (Just/Only)
"Solo" is commonly used to mean "just" or "only." It is used to indicate a small amount, a single option, or to emphasize a restriction or limitation.

- **Example**:
  - "Ho solo cinque euro." (I just have five euros.)
  - "Solo tu puoi aiutarmi." (Only you can help me.)

### 2. Appena (Just/Recently)
"Appena" is used to indicate something that has just happened or just been done. It can also mean "as soon as."

- **Example**:
  - "Ho appena finito di mangiare." (I just finished eating.)
  - "Appena arrivo, ti chiamo." (As soon as I arrive, I'll call you.)

### 3. Appunto (Exactly/Just)
"Appunto" can mean "just" in the sense of "exactly" or "precisely." It is often used to agree with someone or to emphasize that something is exactly as stated.

- **Example**:
  - "È appunto quello che volevo dire." (That's exactly what I wanted to say.)
  - "Appunto, hai ragione." (Exactly, you are right.)

### 4. Proprio (Just/Really)
"Proprio" can mean "just" in the sense of "really" or "truly." It is used to emphasize the truth or intensity of a statement. It can also mean "own" in different contexts.

- **Example**:
  - "È proprio un bel film." (It's really a good movie.)
  - "È la mia propria casa." (It's my own house.)

### Usage Tips:
- **Solo**: Use it to indicate "only" or "just" in terms of limitation or a small amount.
- **Appena**: Use it to indicate something that has "just" happened or to mean "as soon as."
- **Appunto**: Use it to agree with someone or to emphasize that something is "exactly" or "just" as stated.
- **Proprio**: Use it to emphasize the truth or intensity of a statement, translating to "just" or "really."
