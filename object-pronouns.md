# Direct and Indirect Object Pronouns

| Pronoun Type | 1st Person Singular | 2nd Person Singular | 3rd Person Singular | 1st Person Plural | 2nd Person Plural | 3rd Person Plural |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Direct Object Pronouns | mi (me) | ti (you) | lo (him), la (her), La (you formal) | ci (us) | vi (you plural) | li (them masc.), le (them fem.) |
| Indirect Object Pronouns | mi (to me) | ti (to you) | gli (to him), le (to her), Le (to you formal) | ci (to us) | vi (to you plural) | loro (to them) |

Please note that the pronouns "mi", "ti", "ci", and "vi" are the same for both direct and indirect objects. The third person pronouns are different for direct and indirect objects. Also, the formal "you" (Le, La) is capitalized in Italian.

## Direct Object Pronouns

Direct object pronouns in Italian are used to replace the noun that directly receives the action of a verb. They differ from English in several ways, particularly in the third person where Italian uses different forms for direct and indirect objects.

Here are the direct object pronouns in Italian:

- First person singular: `mi` (me)
- Second person singular: `ti` (you)
- Third person singular: `lo` (him, it), `la` (her, it), `La` (you formal)
- First person plural: `ci` (us)
- Second person plural: `vi` (you plural)
- Third person plural: `li` (them masculine), `le` (them feminine), `Li`/`Le` (you plural formal)

These pronouns precede the verb, except for the present participle, the infinitive, and certain imperative forms. They are always unstressed and are pronounced as if they were part of the preceding or following verb forms, even if they are written as separate words.

For example, "I'm looking for the book, but I can't find it" translates to "Cerco il libro, ma non lo trovo" in Italian. Here, "lo" is the direct object pronoun replacing "the book".

In compound tenses, the past participle agrees with `lo`, `la`, `li`, and `le`. The pronouns `lo` and `la` become `l'` before a vowel; the pronouns `li` and `le` do not elide.

In verb + infinitive constructions, the object pronoun follows the infinitive and is attached to it in writing. The final `-e` of the infinitive is dropped when an object pronoun is added.

Several verbs that take indirect objects in English take direct objects in Italian. These include "ascoltare" (to listen to), "aspettare" (to wait for), "cercare" (to look for), "chiedere" (to ask for), "guardare" (to look at), and "pagare" (to pay for).

| Giovanni abita lontano. Non lo vedo mai. | Giovanni lives far away. I never see him. | Use of `lo` as a direct object pronoun replacing "him". |
| Questi corsi cominciano ad annoiarmi. | These courses are beginning to bore me. | Use of `mi` attached to the infinitive `annoiare` to indicate "me". |
| Forse devi abbandonarli. | Maybe you ought to drop them. | Use of `li` attached to the infinitive `abbandonare` to indicate "them". |
| Possiamo aiutarvi? | Can we help you? | Use of `vi` attached to the infinitive `aiutare` to indicate "you". |

| Che bella poltrona! Dove l'avevi comprata? | What a beautiful armchair! Where did you buy it? | Shortening of `la` to `l'` before a word that starts with a vowel. |

## Indirect Object Pronouns

Indirect object pronouns in Italian are used to replace the noun to whom or for whom an action is performed. They precede the verb and do not require the preposition `a` unlike indirect object nouns. 

Here are the indirect object pronouns in Italian:

- First person singular: `mi` (to me)
- Second person singular: `ti` (to you)
- Third person singular: `gli` (to him), `le` (to her), `Le` (to you formal)
- First person plural: `ci` (to us)
- Second person plural: `vi` (to you plural)
- Third person plural: `loro` (to them), `Loro` (to you plural formal)

`Loro` is the indirect object pronoun of the third person plural (to them). Unlike the other pronouns, `loro` follows the verb. In modern Italian, it is often replaced by `gli`.

Several verbs that take a direct object of the person in English take an indirect object in Italian. 

| Italian Equivalent | English Verb |
| --- | --- |
| chiedere a qlcu | to ask someone |
| convenire a qlcu | to suit someone |
| disobbedire a qlcu | to disobey someone |
| domandare a qlcu | to ask someone |
| insegnare a qlcu | to teach someone |
| obbedire a qlcu | to obey someone |
| pagare a qlcu | to pay someone |
| piacere a qlcu | to please someone |
| rispondere a qlcu | to answer someone |

Many Italian verbs take two objects: a direct object (a thing) and an indirect object (a person).

| cantare qlco a qlcu | to sing something for someone |

## Double Object Pronouns

In Italian, pairs of object pronouns can occur together, which is not common in English. When two pronouns occur together, they follow a fixed order. In combinations of a direct and an indirect object pronoun, the indirect object precedes the direct object. When an indirect object pronoun precedes another pronoun, it changes its form as follows:

- mi -> me
- ti -> te
- gli -> glie
- le -> glie
- ci -> ce
- vi -> ve

The indirect object pronoun "glie" is written as a single word with a following direct object pronoun, whether it precedes the verb form or follows it. In the latter case, the "glie" form is attached to the verb in writing.

When "loro" occurs with a direct object, it follows the verb and the direct object precedes. However, in everyday Italian, "loro" is replaced by "gli" and is written as one word with a following direct object pronoun.

Double object pronouns follow the same rules of position as single object pronouns. They cannot be separated from each other. For instance, in a verb + infinitive construction consisting of "dovere", "potere", or "volere", the pair of double object pronouns either is placed before the first verb or is attached to the infinitive.

Here are some examples:

| Italian | English |
| --- | --- |
| Me lo puoi restituire? | Can you give it back to me? | Use of `me lo` as double object pronouns replacing "it to me". |
| Puoi restituirmelo? | Can you give it back to me? | Use of `melo` attached to the infinitive `restituire` to indicate "it to me". |

Note that the incorrect form would be "Me puoi restituirlo?"

In sentences, these double object pronouns can be used to express actions done for someone else. For example:

| Italian | English | Concept Highlighted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Glielo dico io. | I'll tell him/her. | Use of `glielo` as double object pronouns replacing "it to him/her". |
| Glielo mandiamo subito. | We're sending it off to them right away. | Use of `glielo` as double object pronouns replacing "it to them". |
| Non ve le ha spiegate il direttore vendite? | Didn't the sales manager explain them to you? | Use of `ve le` as double object pronouns replacing "them to you". |
| Perché non me le mostri? | Why don't you show them to me? | Use of `me le` as double object pronouns replacing "them to me". |
| Domani gliela restituisco. | I'll give it back to her tomorrow. | Use of `gliela` as double object pronouns replacing "it to her". |
| Perché ce li hanno chiesti. | Because they asked us for them. | Use of `ce li` as double object pronouns replacing "them to us". |
| Glieli sto copiando adesso. | I'm copying them for you right now. | Use of `glieli` as double object pronouns replacing "them to him/her". |
| Portameli, per favore. | Bring them to me, please. | Use of `meli` attached to the command `porta` to indicate "them to me". |
| Si, e oggi voglio darglieli. | Yes, and I want to give them to them today. | Use of `glieli` as double object pronouns replacing "them to them". |

## Summary of Placement

In Italian, object pronouns (single or double) are typically placed before the conjugated verb. For example:

| Italian | English | Concept Highlighted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cerco il disco rigido esterno, ma non lo trovo. | I'm looking for the portable hard drive, but I can't find it. | Placement of `lo` before the conjugated verb `trovo`. |
| Vedo che hai comprato il libro di chimica. Me lo presti? | I see you've bought the chemistry book. Will you lend it to me? | Placement of `me lo` before the conjugated verb `presti`. |

In verb + infinitive constructions, single or double object pronouns can be attached to the infinitive. For example:

| Italian | English | Concept Highlighted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Giada ha il mio smartphone. Non so quando intende restituirmelo. | Giada has my smartphone. I don't know when she intends to give it back to me. | Placement of `melo` attached to the infinitive `restituire`. |

If the first verb of a verb + infinitive construction is dovere, potere, preferire, volere, or cominciare a, the object pronoun (single or double) may be either attached to the infinitive or placed before the first verb. For example:

| Italian | English | Concept Highlighted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hai preso appunti in riunione? Me li vuoi mostrare? / Vuoi mostrarmeli? | Did you take notes at the meeting? Will you show them to me? | Placement of `me li` before the conjugated verb `vuoi` or attached to the infinitive `mostrare`. |

With a command form for tu, voi, or noi, an object pronoun follows an affirmative command and is attached to it in writing. For example:

| Italian | English | Concept Highlighted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Voglio quelle forbici. Portamele. | I want those scissors. Bring them to me. | Placement of `mele` attached to the command `porta`. |
| Avete la macchina? Prestatecela. | Do you have your car? Lend it to us. | Placement of `cela` attached to the command `prestate`. |

In a negative command for tu, voi, or noi, an object pronoun usually precedes the verb. For example:

| Italian | English | Concept Highlighted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ho bisogno del telefonino. Non me lo togliere. | I need my cell phone. Don’t take it away from me. | Placement of `me lo` before the negative command `togliere`. |
| Non voglio vedere l'ammontare delle vendite. Non me lo domandate. | I don't want to see the sales figures. Don't ask me for them. | Placement of `me lo` before the negative command `domandate`. |

An object pronoun can also follow a negative command; in this case, it is attached to the command form. For example:

| Italian | English |
| --- | --- |
| Non togliermelo. | Don't take it away from me. |
| Non domandatemelo. | Don't ask me for them. |

An object pronoun precedes a formal command, whether it is affirmative or negative. For example:

| Italian | English | Concept Highlighted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Melo dia, per favore. | Give it to me, please. | Placement of `melo` before the formal command `dia`. |
| Non me lo dia. | Don't give it to me. | Placement of `me lo` before the negative formal command `dia`. |

When an object pronoun is added to a one-syllable command form, the first consonant of the pronoun is doubled. For example:

| Italian | English | Concept Highlighted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fallo. | Do it. | Placement of `lo` attached to the one-syllable command `fa`. |
| Dammi i soldi. | Give me the money. | Placement of `mmi` attached to the one-syllable command `da`. |
| Dicci la verita. | Tell us the truth. | Placement of `cci` attached to the one-syllable command `di`. |

When it is necessary to highlight a direct object pronoun, it is replaced by a stressed pronoun. These stressed pronouns are usually placed after the verb form. For example:

| Italian | English | Concept Highlighted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Voglio vedere lui, non lei. | I want to see him, not her. | Use of stressed pronouns `lui` and `lei` after the verb `vedere`. |
| Loro cercano me, non voi. | They're looking for me, not you. | Use of stressed pronouns `me` and `voi` after the verb `cercano`. |
