# Tenses

A very brief overview of Italian tenses

## Present Indicative

To conjugate verbs in the _present indicative_ tense drop **-are**, **-ere**, and **-ire** infinitive endings and add the following:

| Pronoun   | First (-are) | Second (-ere) | Third (1) (-ire) | Third (2) (-ire) |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| (io)      | -o           | -o            | -o               | -isco            |
| (tu)      | -i           | -i            | -i               | -isci            |
| (lui/lei) | -a           | -e            | -e               | -isce            |
| (noi)     | -iamo        | -iamo         | -iamo            | -iamo            |
| (voi)     | -ate         | -ete          | -ite             | -ite             |
| (loro)    | -ano         | -ono          | -ono             | -iscono          |

## Past Indicative

Past indicative tenses such as the _present perfect_ and the _pluperfect_ are compound tenses, formed with an auxiliary verb plus the _past participle_ of of the verb, in that order.

### Past Participle

To form the past participle of regular verbs, drop the infinitive ending and add **-ato**, **-uto**, or **-ito**.

| Infinitive | Participle  | Meaning    |
|------------|-------------|------------|
| parlare    | parl**ato** | _spoken_   |
| vendere    | vend**uto** | _sold_     |
| finire     | fin**ito**  | _finished_ |

### Present Perfect

The _present perfect_ tense is used to express simple actions completed at the present time.  It is formed with two auxiliary verbs, _avere_ and _essere_, conjugated in the present indicative.  

#### Avere

| Pronoun   | Auxiliary | Participle | Meaning                              |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| (io)      | ho        | parlato    | I have spoken, I spoke               |
| (tu)      | hai       | parlato    | You have spoken, you spoke           |
| (lui/lei) | ha        | parlato    | He/She has/have spoken, he/she spoke |
| (noi)     | abbiamo   | parlato    | We have spoken, we spoke             |
| (voi)     | avete     | parlato    | You have spoken, you spoke           |
| (loro)    | hanno     | parlato    | They have spoken, they spoke         |

#### Essere

The past participle of verbs conjugated with _essere_ agrees in number and gender with the subject.

| Pronoun   | Auxiliary | Participle | Meaning                                   |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| (io)      | sono      | uscito/a   | I have gone out, I went out               |
| (tu)      | sei       | uscito/a   | You have gone out, you went out           |
| (lui/lei) | è         | uscito/a   | He/She has/have gone out, he/she went out |
| (noi)     | siamo     | usciti/e   | We have gone out, we went out             |
| (voi)     | siete     | usciti/e   | You have gone out, you went out           |
| (loro)    | sono      | usciti/e   | They have gone out, they went out         |

### Imperfect

The _imperfect_ tense is used to express actions that continued for an indefinite period of time, habitual or repeated actions in the past, and to describe the characteristics of people and things as they used to be.

To conjugate verbs in the _imperfect_ tense drop **-re** from infinitive endings and add the following:

| Pronoun   | Ending |
|-----------|--------|
| (io)      | -vo    |
| (tu)      | -vi    |
| (lui/lei) | -va    |
| (noi)     | -vamo  |
| (voi)     | -vate  |
| (loro)    | -vano  |

## Simple Future

The _simple future_ is used to express an action that will occur in the future.

For the first conjugation, change the **-are** ending to -**er**, for the second and third conjugations drop the **-e**.  Add the following endings.

| Pronoun   | Ending |
|-----------|--------|
| (io)      | -ò     |
| (tu)      | -ai    |
| (lui/lei) | -à     |
| (noi)     | -emo   |
| (voi)     | -ete   |
| (loro)    | -anno  |
